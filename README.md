Perfect! Here's a polished `README.md` for your **Archism** project:

---

# üß± Archism

**One-shot Arch Linux installation and setup** for an empty disk (SSD/HDD).
Archism automates the **entire installation process**, from disk partitioning to a ready-to-use graphical environment, shell, drivers, and tools ‚Äî in just **one command**.

---

## üöÄ Features

* üßπ Auto-wipes and partitions your disk (GPT + UEFI)
* ‚öôÔ∏è Installs the full Arch base system
* üñ•Ô∏è Sets up your chosen Desktop Environment (e.g., Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, etc.)
* üß© Installs NVIDIA drivers, Docker, and developer tools
* üåç Configures locale, timezone, keymap
* üë§ Creates your user account with Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh
* üîí Enables LightDM, Docker, and NetworkManager services
* üîÅ Installs and configures GRUB EFI bootloader

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* A system with UEFI firmware (not legacy BIOS)
* Internet access (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
* A blank disk (e.g., `/dev/sda`) that will be erased!

---

## üîß Run Scripts

> Boot into the Arch ISO, connect to the internet, then run:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthur/archism/main/0-auto-install.sh
chmod +x 0-auto-install.sh
sudo ./0-auto-install.sh
```

The script will:

1. Partition and format your disk
2. Install the base system
3. Chroot and run the post-install script
4. Set up everything automatically
5. Reboot into your new Arch desktop

---

## üìÅ Files

| File                | Description                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `1-arch-setup.sh`   | Runs *inside chroot*. Installs drivers, DE, tools, configures system.      |

---

## üß™ Customization

You can edit the top variables of `0-auto-install.sh`:

```bash
DISK="/dev/sda"
HOSTNAME="archbox"
USERNAME="username"
LOCALE="en_US.UTF-8" # "pt_BR.UTF-8"
TIMEZONE="America/Sao_Paulo"
UI="cinnamon"   # Options: cinnamon, gnome, plasma, xfce4, etc.

```

Add your own packages and services, as needed!

Let me know if you want help:

* Creating this GitHub repo
* Making a **custom Arch ISO image** that includes your scripts by default
* Adding Wi-Fi detection, LUKS encryption, or Btrfs snapshots

I can also make an interactive menu version (`archism-tui`) for advanced control.
